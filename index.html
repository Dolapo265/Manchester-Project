                        Manchester is a major city in northwest England with a population of over half a million. It played a key role in the Industrial Revolution and was once a global hub for textile manufacturing, earning it the nickname "Cottonopolis" in the 19th century. Many of its old mills and factories still stand, now transformed into museums, apartments, and creative spaces. One standout is the Science and Industry Museum, which explores the city’s engineering and industrial roots.

                        The city is also passionate about football. Home to Manchester United and Manchester City, it comes alive on match days. Music is another big part of its identity. Bands like Oasis, The Smiths, and Joy Division all got their start here, and live music still thrives across local venues and festivals.
