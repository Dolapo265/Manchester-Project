Manchester Mini-Site
This project is a simple HTML page built to explore and practice semantic HTML. The content focuses on the city of Manchester and is designed to demonstrate how meaningful HTML structure can make content more accessible, readable, and well-organized.

Purpose
The main goal is to:

Use semantic HTML elements correctly (header, nav, main, section, article, figure, aside, footer, etc.)

Build a clear, accessible structure without relying on styling or JavaScript

Understand how HTML tags communicate content roles to browsers and assistive technologies

Features
A navigation bar with internal links

A main article section about Manchesterâ€™s history and culture

A figure element with a captioned image

An aside section highlighting extra facts and features

Media elements (video, image, and audio) to showcase the city's vibe

A footer with author credit and contact link

Notes
No external CSS or JavaScript is used here, this project is purely focused on clean, meaningful HTML

The media files (images, video, audio) are local and should be stored in the same folder as the HTML file
